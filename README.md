## Features
- User Registration
- Integration with a backend server (API)

  ### Running the App

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tatendamarimo/FitnessTrackingApp.git
    ```
    
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**.

3. In the app, the **registration** feature is integrated with the backend API. Ensure that you replace the backend URL with your own public server URL where the registration logic is implemented.

4. Build and run the app on an Android emulator or device.

### Backend Setup 
- The app communicates with a backend API for the **registration** process. You need to set up an API that handles user registration and stores the fitness data.
